# Components Directory

This directory follows the strict container-presenter architecture pattern:

## Directory Structure Pattern
```
ComponentName/
  ├── useComponentName.ts     (Container - business logic)
  ├── ComponentName.tsx       (Presenter - UI only)
  └── ChildComponent/         (Child components as subdirectories)
      ├── useChildComponent.ts
      └── ChildComponent.tsx
```

## Rules
1. Maximum one container-presenter pair per directory
2. All child components must be in subdirectories
3. Containers (hooks) contain all business logic and state
4. Presenters are pure UI components receiving props from containers
5. Use TypeScript strict mode with explicit typing
